            <h2>Welcome TV show lovers!</h2>
            <p>This great site is happy to bring you your favourite TV show's <i>details</i>.</p>
            <p>Codecool is famous about its great community.
                One of the reasons for this is the time spent well together â€“
                such as watching TV shows! That's why there is a need
                for a great website where all Codecoolers can find their favorite series.</p>
            <p>Your job is to create such a site. The design has been already made
                by the marketing team, there is also a database that is ready
                (thanks to trakt.tv), you "only" have to connect the dots
                and present the data in a digestible way.</p>
